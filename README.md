# Yukai Tech Next.js Website + Blog

Yukai Technologies is a company that I created to find
Corp-to-corp opportunities and facilitate part-time
contract work. The website is fully designed and built
by me. The app is written in Next.js with GraphQL API 
bindings to Contentful (headless CMS) to manage the
blog. It is fully deployed using AWS Amplify w/ Route53
domain registration.

This website is still in-progress, so check back 
to see new updates.
